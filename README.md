# ZebraSwish
Cross-platform tool for analyzing zebrafish swimming behavior

Very much under development and completely unready for real use.

The idea is that this tool will allow you to select a video file (or maybe a video stream from a camera), and automatically (or with use adjustment) detect zebrafish in view, and then produce a graph of the angle of their body as they swim.
