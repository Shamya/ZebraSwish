Dependencies:
	OpenCV: http://opencv.org/
	pillow: pip install pillow
	Numpy?
	Scikit?
	
	Probable codec issues when installing. The only way I was able to solve it
		was by installing the appropriate opencv wheel from
		http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#opencv
		(Christoph Gohlke, who maintains that site, is a fucking hero, btw)
